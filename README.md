# ðŸŒ± TupuPlatform MVP

**Transparent Climate Finance Tracking Using Blockchain**  
An open-source MVP prototype built on the Polygon Amoy testnet using Solidity smart contracts and Foundry.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

TupuPlatform is a blockchain-based system for managing and monitoring climate adaptation projects in Samoa and the Pacific.

It enables:

- Transparent tracking of donor funds
- Tokenized representation of project budgets (1:1 to escrowed funds)
- Smart contractâ€“based deliverable validation and approval
- Role-based project access for funders, clients, and contractors
- A foundation for future carbon tracking and risk analysis tools

---

## ðŸ§± MVP Smart Contract Modules (Planned)

- `TupuFinance.sol`: Core fund/milestone/payment logic
- `TupuRegistry.sol`: Role and identity registration
- `ProjectToken.sol`: Token to represent project-specific budgets
- `DeliverableVault.sol`: Submit and verify proof-of-deliverables

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Foundry** (Solidity toolchain)
- **Polygon Amoy** testnet
- **IPFS / Pinata** (Planned for file validation)
- **Google Cloud / Firebase** (Future off-chain integration)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Status

This repository has been initialized with the development environment, and the smart contract architecture is being implemented.

Smart contract testing and simulations will begin with on-chain logic for token-based fund tracking and milestone verification.

We are using this repo as the official build environment for SPREP's PCCC Climate Innovation MVP.

- Tokenized Climate Finance Instruments (CFI)
- Escrow-based project payment logic
- Carbon footprint calculation backend
- Immutable tracking of deliverables and payments
- Transparent dashboards for stakeholders and funders

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
- Solidity `^0.8.21`
- Polygon Amoy testnet (EVM compatible)
- IPFS / GCP (for off-chain components, future)
- GitHub Projects (for issue tracking & milestones)

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
